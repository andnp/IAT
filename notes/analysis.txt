-Hypothesis
	-Participants will more easily associate extroverts with intelligence
		-Supported 9/20/15 with d=-.70
		-Supported 4/12/16 with corr=-.49 and p=.0000167
	-Implicit bias will be correlated with self-report preference for extroversion
		-Not supported 4/12/16
			-corr=-.2, but p=.101
		-Inverse supported 4/12/16
			-corr=.39, with p=.000908
-Interesting correlations
	-Subjects who considered themselves to be introverted followed the expected pattern of related traits
		-Trait (correlation, p-value)
			-Less talkative (s=.66, p=6.77e-10)
			-More reserved (-.64, 1.676e-9)
			-Less energetic (.54, 1.12e-6)
			-Less enthusiastic (.6, 4.65e-8)
			-More quiet (-.71, 5.25e-12)
			-Less assertive (.35, 2.87e-3)
			-More shy (-.55, 6.25e-7)
			-Less sociable (.74, 4.23e-13)
			-Prefered introverts (.51, 7.08e-6)
			-Feel warmer towards introverts (-.27, .02)
		-Interestingly, there was absolutely no correlation between introversion and explicit perceived intelligence

-Questions that come up
	-We saw incredibly strong/significant correlations with self-reported introversion and self-reported personality traits. Are we introducing a bias in the personality traits by first asking them to identify as intro/extroverted?
